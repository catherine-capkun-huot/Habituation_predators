## Habituation to predator approaches: Online repository for Čapkun-Huot et al. 2022

### About this project 

Habituation, or the decrease of an individual's response to a stimulus with repeated exposure, is a learning process observed in many taxa -- mammals, birds, fish, invertebrates, unicellular organisms, and even plants. We still know little, however, about its adaptive importance and how it has evolved in wild populations. 

Here, we study among-individual variance in habituation and how predation risk influences  habituation. More precisely, we test if (1) perceived predation risk affects habituation; (2) there are differences between individuals in their habituation to approaches; and (3) individuals differ more in certain risk treatments.

To do so, we exposed wild eastern chipmunks (_Tamias striatus_) to repeated flight-initiation distance tests and designed a novel nonlinear model to fit habituation patterns and analyse the data. 


### Description 

This is the online repository to reproduce the models and results presented in:
Čapkun-Huot, C., Garant, D., MacDonald, A., Bergeron, P. & Réale, D. (2022) Sex, personality and predation risk influence habituation to simulated predatory approaches.

This repository contains all the data and code for the paper. 

##### Data
This project requires two data sets: 

1. data_FID.csv/data_FID_analyses.csv
2. ind_charact.csv

Description of these data sets can be found in Metadata_FID_all.txt and Metadata_individuals.txt

##### Code
The analyses and predictions from the models are separated in different .R files:

1. Nonlinear models
2. Figures and predictions
